# GOGOA Landing Page

This landing page was built for GOGOA Studio, a creative storytelling hub dedicated to bridging the gap between science and effective storytelling.

## Project Structure

The landing page consists of six main sections:

1. **Hero Section** - About section that serves as the landing screen with a "Register Now" button that scrolls to the form.
2. **What You'll Experience** - Highlights what participants will gain from the workshop.
3. **Workshop Details** - Information about a specific workshop event.
4. **Benefits Section** - The advantages of the storytelling approach.
5. **Testimonials** - Success stories from previous participants.
6. **Contact Form** - Registration form integrated with Email.js.
